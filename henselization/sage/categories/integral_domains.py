r"""
Adds a ``henselization`` method to many rings in Sage.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from henselization import *
    sage: ZZ.henselization(2)
    Henselization of Integer Ring with respect to 2-adic valuation

            Return the henselization of this ring at ``prime``.

            .. NOTE:

                IntegralDomains() is probably not the right place to put this
                generic method. It could be wherever a valuation(prime) method
                is present. So, if this package ever gets into Sage, this
                method should be added manually to all the rings that implement
                valuation(prime), i.e., number fields, orders, function fields,
                (and padics, where it's trivial.)
